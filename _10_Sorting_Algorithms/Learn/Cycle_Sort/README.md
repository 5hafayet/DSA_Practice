## Cyclic Sort

Cyclic Sort is an efficient in-place sorting algorithm that works well when the input consists of integers in a certain range. It is based on the idea of placing each element in its correct position by performing a series of cyclic swaps.

The basic idea behind cyclic sort is to iterate through the array and place each element in its correct position by swapping it with the element at that position. This process is repeated until all elements are in their correct positions.

The key steps of the Cyclic Sort algorithm are as follows:

1. Start iterating through the array from the beginning.
2. For each element, check if it is in its correct position by comparing it with its index.
3. If the element is not in its correct position, swap it with the element at its correct position.
4. Continue swapping elements until the current element is in its correct position.
5. Move to the next element and repeat steps 2-4 until all elements are sorted.

Cyclic Sort has a time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of elements in the array, as it requires iterating through the array only once. It is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm, especially when the input elements are in a limited range.

It's worth noting that Cyclic Sort assumes the input contains distinct elements from 1 to N (or 0 to N-1), and it may not work correctly if the input has duplicates or elements outside the expected range.

Cyclic Sort can be used to solve various problems, such as finding missing numbers, duplicates, or sorting arrays with limited ranges efficiently.
