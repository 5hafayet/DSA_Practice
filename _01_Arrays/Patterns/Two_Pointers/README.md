1. [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/): Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

2. [Three Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/): Given an array, find all unique triplets that sum up to zero. This variant uses three pointers and is often an extension of the two-pointer technique.

3. [Four Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/): Similar to Three Sum but finding all unique quadruplets that sum up to a target value.

4. [Cycle Detection](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/): Used in linked lists and arrays where elements form a cycle. Two pointers move at different speeds, and if there's a cycle, they will eventually meet.

5. [Remove Duplicates](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/): Given a sorted array, remove duplicates in-place using two pointers to track distinct elements.

6. [Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/): Find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum. This is typically solved using Kadane's algorithm, which is a variant of the two-pointer technique.

7. [Merge Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/): Given two sorted arrays, merge them into a single sorted array using two pointers.

8. [Intersection of Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii/): Given two sorted arrays, find their intersection using two pointers.

9. [Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/): Given two strings, find the minimum window in the first string that contains all the characters from the second string. This variant uses two pointers to create a sliding window.

10. [Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/): Given an array of heights, find two lines that together with the x-axis forms a container that holds the most water. This is solved using two pointers
