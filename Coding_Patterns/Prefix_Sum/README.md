Prefix sum is a technique used to efficiently compute the sum of elements within a specified range in an array. It involves preprocessing the array to generate a prefix sum array, where each element at index `i` stores the cumulative sum of elements from index 0 to `i` in the original array. This allows for quick calculation of the sum of elements within a range `[left, right]` using the formula `prefixSum[right + 1] - prefixSum[left]`. This technique is beneficial for scenarios requiring frequent range sum queries on the same array, reducing the time complexity from linear to constant time for each query.

Certainly! Here are some problems related to both monotonic increasing and decreasing queues:

2. **Next Greater Element II:** [LeetCode Problem 503](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/)
   - Given a circular array `nums`, find the next greater element for each element in the array.

3. **Trapping Rain Water:** [LeetCode Problem 42](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)
   - Given an array representing the heights of walls, calculate how much rainwater can be trapped after a rainfall.

4. **Constrained Subsequence Sum:** [LeetCode Problem 1425](https://leetcode.com/problems/constrained-subsequence-sum/)
   - Given an array of integers and an integer `k`, find the maximum sum of any non-empty subsequence such that for every `x` in the subsequence, `x + k` is not in the subsequence.

**Monotonic Decreasing Queue (Deque):**

1. **Maximum of Minimums in All Subarrays:** [LeetCode Problem 907](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subarray-minimums/)
